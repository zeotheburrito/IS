  <p class="w3-container">Our inspiration for this project came throughout our History classes about the 
  Japanese Occupation, and we felt that we wanted people to understand Singapore’s 
  rich history better. Thus, we created a project that aims to aid students in 
  learning History - more specifically about the Japanese Occupation - while having 
  fun and also instill students’ interest in the subject of History, and it 
  comprises of a board game on the Japanese Occupation for Secondary One students, 
  and we hope that this project will be beneficial towards aiding students in their 
  development of historical knowledge.

  <p class="w3-container">
  First, we will be analysing the practicality of board games in learning. 
  Generally speaking, board games are shown to teach children number 
  and shape recognition, grouping and counting, letter recognition and reading,   
  visual perception and colour recognition, and hand-eye coordination and manual 
  dexterity, all essential skills that children must learn. This shows that board 
  games have the ability to teach other forms of skills too.

  <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2sZC3QD"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
  <br/><br/>
  Besides that, face-to-face interaction is inevitable while playing any board 
  game. <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/1nFd4L5"><sup>[3]</sup></a> This encourages 
  discussion between players about the board game itself, and even some concepts 
  that they learn from it.
  <br/><br/>
  Finally, a board game was designed to further students learning in the field of 
  pediatric medicine. Players advanced by answering questions, 
  which were crafted with emphasis in content from core pediatric textbooks 
  correctly. A survey was conducted on 37 medical  
  students and 12 residents who completed the board game to assess the extent to 
  which they understand the purpose of the game. The survey responses 
  suggest that they observed that the board game was a practical and             
  engaging learning experience. <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2sZxvK4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> 
  This seems to suggest that board game are effective in spreading 
  knowledge and can be used for educational purposes. Several other sites also seem 
  to agree with this idea. A numerical board game created for classroom 
  teaching made the children engaged in it, and also show signs of improvement in     numerical knowledge in the children.

  In order to accomplish our project, we plan to do our research about the Japanese 
  Occupation through various mediums like the Internet, libraries, the Former Ford 
  Factory and much more. Besides that, we also will try to encompass the traits of a 
  fun board game based on your reviews so that it pleases the crowd and edit the 
  project. Of course, we have organised our timeline to make sure everything is done in 
  time and with quality.

  Through the project, I have learnt the significance of history in our lives. I have learnt how history has impacted our society and how it has changed our lives. Also, through cooperation with my teammates, I have learnt how to work with each other to get a job done. I also had to plan my time properly so that I did not miss out anything for the project. <br/>

  In the process of creating this board game, I cooperated a lot with my groupmates which increased our relationship with us. Other than that, I would also like to reflect on some of my actions. During the holidays, I did not get to some meetings because of personal reasons. Some of the meetings that I missed are actually quite important. Due to that reason, I had to find ways to catch up on the project. <br/>
  <strong>Wong Zenwei</strong> <br/>
  During my time doing our project, I usually was very nervous and kept rushing to complete our project, which made me a little stress. However, I realised that there is no use rushing to complete the product, as this project spans for a year for a reason. I think we should all learn to over-prioritise our tasks, doing it at a constant pace and take it slow when it is hard to cope, so that we can complete it with a healthier state of mind and make it even better. <br/>
  <strong>Chin Cherng Yuen</strong> <br/>
  I think I have benefitted from this project. Firstly, we needed to have knowledge on the Japanese Occupation to create this board game, I needed to do research on things such as resources that were used during the Japanese Occupation. This helped broaden my knowledge. Secondly, I learnt to cooperate with other people to enhance productivity. During the time when we were discussing, we tended to stray off the main topic. Through this, I learnt to keep in topic and cooperate with my group members.

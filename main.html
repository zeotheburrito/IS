        We are a group of students from 1O3 and first of - thank you for visiting our site! Our group aims to aid Secondary One students         in their learning of history, but more exactly, the era of the <b>Japanese Occupation</b>. We aim to achieve this through the           form of a board game - one that can teach students while they are having fun.

       Our inspiration for this project came throughout our History classes about the Japanese Occupation, and we felt that we wanted          people to understand Singapore’s rich history better. Thus, we created a project that aims to aid students in learning History -        more specifically about the Japanese Occupation - while having fun and also instill students’ interest in the subject of History,        and it comprises of a board game on the Japanese Occupation for Secondary One students, and we hope that this project will be            beneficial towards aiding students in their development of historical knowledge.

        <strong>Literary Review</strong>
        <br/>
        First, we will be analysing the practicality of board games in learning. Generally speaking, board games are shown to teach             children number and shape recognition, grouping and counting, letter recognition and reading, visual perception and colour               recognition, and hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity, all essential skills that children must learn. This shows that             board games have the ability to teach other forms of skills too. <a href="http://bit.ly/2tDhCrC"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a                   href="http://bit.ly/2sZC3QD"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
        <br/><br/>
        Besides that, face-to-face interaction is inevitable while playing any board game. <a href="http://bit.ly/1nFd4L5"><sup>[3]             </sup></a> This encourages discussion between players about the board game itself, and even some concepts that they learn from           it.
        <br/><br/>
        Finally, a board game was designed to further students learning in the field of pediatric medicine. Players advanced by                 answering questions, which were crafted with emphasis in content from core pediatric textbooks correctly, correctly. A                   survey was conducted on 37 medical students and 12 residents who completed the board game to assess the extent to which they             understand the purpose of the game. The survey responses suggest that they observed that the board game was a practical and             engaging learning experience. <a href="http://bit.ly/2sZxvK4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This seems to suggest that board game are               effective in spreading knowledge and can be used for educational purposes. Several other sites also seem to agree with this             idea. A numerical board game created for classroom teaching made the children engaged in it, and also show signs of improvement         in numerical knowledge in the children. <a href="http://bit.ly/2sKGjzD"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
        <br/><br/>
        Now, we will be analysing the necessity of spreading historical understanding. Researchers in America once conducted a research         on their students knowledge of History and they found out that most of the students lack historical knowledge. <a                       href="http://bit.ly/2udDifB"><sup>[6]</sup></a> They also found out that most American students have been lacking knowledge of           History ever since 1943. <a href="http://n.pr/1PbKk8X"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Other than that, researchers also found out that a lot         of Singaporeans did not know about Operation Coldstore. They found out that only 16.65% of the 1500 citizens in the survey knew         about Operation Coldstore, and 18.5% were aware of Operation Spectrum. <a href="http://bit.ly/2t92Wge"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

        In order to accomplish our project, we plan to do our research about the Japanese Occupation through various mediums like the           Internet, libraries, the Former Ford Factory and much more. Besides that, we also will try to encompass the traits of a fun             board game based on your reviews so that it pleases the crowd and edit the project. Of course, we have organised our timeline to         make sure everything is done in time and with quality.
